    "text": "A Quarto and GitHub Pages Guide for the noob bloggers\n\n\nThis article serves as a compilation of online resources for Git, GitHub and Quarto, in order to inform readers eager to enter the world of blogging using GitHub pages.\n\nGit and Github\n\nTo get started with Git and GitHub, the following resources are recommended:\n\n\nThe Odin Project - Introduction to Git\n\n\nThe Odin Project - Foundations in Git\n\n\nThe Odin Project - Commit messages\n\n\nTo configure ssh (Secure Shell, a newly adopted path for authentication by Github and Git) follow the following steps.\n\nStep 1: Make sure Git is installed into your system (along with Git bash if you are on Windows)\n\n\nStep 2: Configure your Git\n\ngit config --global user.name &lt;YourName&gt;\ngit config --global user.email &lt;you@example.com&gt;\n\nClick on the green Code button, select SSH if not already selected, and copy the address displayed there.\nRun the command:\ngit clone &lt;Paste what you copied&gt;\nGetting a warning with: “The authenticity of host ‘github.com’ can’t be established.” should not worry you. If this is the first time you connect to this server, you will get this warning. Select “yes” and it won’t bother you again.\n\nStep 3: \n\nGenerating an SSH key We will be using a tool called ssh-keygen. So open a terminal and run this command:\nssh-keygen\nFirst, you will be asked about the location where the keys should be stored. By default, your user folder will contain a folder called .ssh. Leave it as it is and hit the Enter key. Next, you will be asked to set a password to protect your private key. Without a password, anyone obtaining your private key can impersonate you. You now have two files called id_rsa and id_rsa.pub which are your private and public keys respectively (for encryption). Open your public key (id_rsa.pub) from the directory you saved it in and copy the entire content of the files.\n\nStep 4: \n\nConnecting your Git to your GitHub using SSH Click on your profile on the top right corner of your GitHub home page.\n\nGo to settings &gt; SSH and GPG keys. Click on ‘New SSH key’ and paste the copied content into the large text box. Name your key.\n\nStep 5: \n\nClone your GitHub repository using the command used previously Step 6 — Cloning a GitHub repository (again)\nNow it is time to rerun the clone command, and it should work.\nNow Git is integrated with any tools or code editors that you may be using. You can push and pull changes from GitHub without issues.\ngit clone &lt;SSH link copied from code of your GitHub repo as done in Step 2&gt;\nThis should work as intended.\n\nQuarto\n\nTo get started with Quarto, the following link is recommended: Getting Started with Quarto. Moreover, the documentation in Quarto is fairly simple and easy to understand. So please use the documentation when you face any kind of problem. Refer to this link to completely learn how authoring in Quarto works: Authoring in Quarto. For a complete view of their documentation, please visit: Quarto Documentation\n\nSetting up a Blog in Quarto\n\nThis guide uses VSCode for setting up and authoring blogs using Quarto. You can use other editors/tools to author as well.\n\nStep 1: \n\nCreate a new repository in your GitHub and give it a name that’s short and simple because that will later be included in the URL of your blog if you choose to publish it on GitHub.\n\nStep 2: \n\nIn your terminal, navigate to the folder you want to your blog to be in. Run\ngit clone &lt;ssh URL of your repo&gt;\nto clone the newly created repository on to your computer.\n\nStep 3: \n\nIn VSCode, install the “Quarto” extension. Then, open the new repository’s folder. Press ctrl + shift + p to open the command palette and search for “Quarto: Create Project”.\n\nChoose “Blog Project” among the options.\n\nAnd select the folder of your repository when asked for location of the project. You now have a bare-bones blog up and running! Type quarto preview in the terminal (make sure you are inside the repo) to see how your blog looks!\n\nStep 4: \n\nTo create a new post, first create a new directory (folder) inside the posts directory. Then, create a new file named index.qmd. You should write your post in this file in the markdown format. Refer here to know more.\n\n\n\nExample structure of a blog\n\n\n\nBonus: \n\nYou can add both dark and light themes to your blog by editing your _quarto.yml file like so:\n\nPlease go through the documentation for more such tricks and customizations.\nAfter editing your blog, go to the directory of the blog using cd command in your system terminal or the vscode terminal (here, the directory named ‘theskywalkerarena’ is the directory of the blog, and ‘Skywalker’ is the parent directory of the blog directory)\n\n(Each line beside ‘&gt;’ is a command given via terminal in the above picture)\nAfter pushing your changes, go to GitHub and to your remote blog repository, and click ‘Settings’ on the upper bar.\n\nClick ‘Pages’ on the side menu.\n\nUnder ‘Build and Deployment’ click on the Drop down menu of the directory your blog is being deployed from, and select /docs instead of /(root), and click on ‘Save’.\n\nAfter following the above steps, go to ‘Actions’ on the upper bar of your repository.\n\n\n\nRealtime Deployment of your Blog in GitHub Pages\n\n\nHere you can see the real-time deployment of your blog online. The URL of your blog is as follows: [Your GitHub username].github.io/[Your blog directory]\nVoila! You have a blog which is up and running! Be sure to share this blog to those in need."

    "text": "Hiya folks! This is the first post in my blog, The Skywalker Arena. Welcome! This post is a brief introduction about me.\nI’m Mohit Nair, and I hail from Bangalore. I am a B. E. Student (Branch of Information Science Engineering), at M. S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology.\n\nHobbies and Interests\n\nI’m in love with and am fascinated by computers, and their capabilities. I do not have very decent coding abilities, but I try my best. My other pastimes are chess, (listening to) music, movies, loitering around in my city, and blogging (you might have already figured that out).\n\nMovies\n\nI am very fond of fictional cinematic universes, such as Star Wars, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the DC Universe, and the Spider-verse. I have also developed a likeness for the Christopher Nolan films, and have watched many of them.\n\nMusic\n\nAs for music, I love R&B, and Pop sections for the most part. However, I have also started listening to instrumentals and soundtracks from certain movies I find amazing (Hans Zimmer’s and John Williams’ works to be precise).\n\nChess\n\nChess is an addictive hobby I have been inculcating since the 2020 pandemic. I have reached 1500 ELO on chess.com if that means anything, although I’d like to classify myself as a novice at the game because of my blunders.\n\nAspirations\n\nI aspire to be proficient in Full Stack Web Development, Data Science, and Machine Learning. I also love the prospect of exploring Natural Language Processing. For now, I’m just an explorer in the above fields.\nMy intention to start this blog was to journal my most notable thoughts, experiences, opinions and questions. So, be my guest, and read through them in your leisure. Thanks for reading!\n(God! this looks like a Wikipedia page)"
