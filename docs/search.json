    "text": "Hiya folks! This is the first post in my blog, The Skywalker Arena. Welcome! This post is a brief introduction about me.\nI’m Mohit Nair, and I hail from Bangalore. I am a B. E. Student (Branch of Information Science Engineering), at M. S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology.\n\nHobbies and Interests\n\nI’m in love with and am fascinated by computers, and their capabilities. I do not have very decent coding abilities, but I try my best. My other pastimes are chess, (listening to) music, movies, loitering around in my city, and blogging (you might have already figured that out).\n\nMovies\n\nI am very fond of fictional cinematic universes, such as Star Wars, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the DC Universe, and the Spider-verse. I have also developed a likeness for the Christopher Nolan films, and have watched many of them.\n\nMusic\n\nAs for music, I love R&B, and Pop sections for the most part. However, I have also started listening to instrumentals and soundtracks from certain movies I find amazing (Hans Zimmer’s and John Williams’ works to be precise).\n\nChess\n\nChess is an addictive hobby I have been inculcating since the 2020 pandemic. I have reached 1500 ELO on chess.com if that means anything, although I’d like to classify myself as a novice at the game because of my blunders.\n\nAspirations\n\nI aspire to be proficient in Full Stack Web Development, Data Science, and Machine Learning. I also love the prospect of exploring Natural Language Processing. For now, I’m just an explorer in the above fields.\nMy intention to start this blog was to journal my most notable thoughts, experiences, opinions and questions. So, be my guest, and read through them in your leisure. Thanks for reading!\n(God! this looks like a Wikipedia page)"

    "text": "A BMTC Bus Pass Guide - for the Students of MSRIT, Bengaluru\n\n\nA BMTC Bus Pass is something every student in Bengaluru should make, if they happen to commute to their institution using the BMTC Bus Services. It saves a lot of money (upto 10 times lesser than the money spend on everyday to and fro tickets), and also rids you of the hassle of always handling and exchanging cash, with change and a thin little shit of a ticket. Here are the steps for creating a bus pass:\nStep 1: Enter this website.\nClick on the highlighted option\n\nStep 2: Fill the application form up\n\nYou will be redirected to a window containing a form as shown in the above picture.\nAll particulars asked in the form must be entered. There are a few which are important.\n\nAdmission number - Enter your Receipt Number (from your Admission Fees Receipt - issued by the college at the time of admission), or your temporary USN.\n\nInstitution Type - Use the drop down menu to enter ‘Technical’\n\nInstitution Name - Enter ‘MS Ramaiah Institute of Technology’\nTravel Route Details - Enter these routes carefully. Please take care of the directions you take during your commute.\nDocument Details - Upload your passport size photo and college-issued Fee Receipt as asked.\nVerify via OTP and submit the form. You will receive a message on the registered phone number, containing your application number for the BMTC Bus Pass.\nStep 3: Go to your office of your respective department, and request the administrator there to verify your application, after providing them with your particulars.\nThe application will be approved by them, and will then make its way to BMTC, where it will again be verified (if the BMTC Verification doesn’t happen within 2-3 days, fill up the application again and resubmit it).\nStep 4: Visit the nearest Bangalore One Government office, and…\nProvide them with your BMTC Bus Pass Application number. Be sure to keep with you your fees receipt, your Aadhar Card and money up to INR 2000-2300 with adequate change. UPI payments are usually NOT accepted for this process. A live photo of yours will be taken at the office, and your pass card will be made. Voila! Your Bus pass is ready!"
